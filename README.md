# OpenFOAM Foundation Release preCICE adapter

## Note

This project is intended to work with Foundation releases only.
This is a fork of original [OpenFOAM preCICE adapter](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter)
and designed while taking into account the code written by @Alphaoo1 and @JaegerSt! from Austrian Institute of 
Technology. 

As of October 2021 it supports building with OpenFOAM-dev and should support OpenFOAM9.

The adapter code also contains VolumeVolume coupling module.

The repository also contains some tutorials.
